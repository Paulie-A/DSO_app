# DSO_app
The DSO App is an express app with functions to calculate DSO (days outstanding) and CEI (Collection Effectiveness index) for measuring accounts receivables collections.

I was inspired to create this app as DSO/CEI is a key performance indicator in my current profession.

To run this app locally run dso.js in node and open http://localhost:3000 in the browser.
